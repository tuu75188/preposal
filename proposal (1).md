# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Chipotle Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Its a game that lets you make a chipotle bowl.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project is an interactive "Chipotle Bowl Builder" game that allows users to create a virtual Chipotle-style burrito bowl by selecting ingredients step-by-step. The software will guide the user through each stage of building a bowl, including choosing a base (rice or lettuce), protein, beans, salsas, toppings, and extras. At each step, the program will show the available options, allow players to select their preferred ingredients, and validate user input. Once the bowl is complete, the program will display a final summary of the user’s customized bowl along with the total price based on the ingredients chosen.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Definitely the prompts if nothing else.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Prompts, final outcome of the bowl, and maybe even a menu.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All of the above as well as maybe using the credit lab we worked on previously to add a transaction feature.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I was to learn how to make complex games and images.
